# Goals of this platform

\tableofcontents <!-- you can use \toc as well -->

This platform is a community effort to work on improving consideration of heterogeneity at the land-atmosphere interface. 
This platform allows:
1. Interactive visualisation of field measurements and model results
1. Benchmark metrics on the capacity of models to capture spatio-temporal heterogeneity 
1. Users can add standardized datasets, models, and benchmark metrics

The source code of this website is hosted on [github] (https://github.com/AlexisRenchon/TEST).

This website and data analysis are open-source, transparent, and users are encouraged to contribute. 

# Distinction from ILAMB

[ILAMB] (https://www.ilamb.org/), the international land model benchmarking project, has some similarities with this platform.
 
LAH (we need a name) focuses on heterogeneity within sub-pixels (area of about a hectar), a smaller scale compared to ILAMB. 
Furthermore, this platform specifically focuses on heterogeneity, rather than benchmarking in general. 
Mechanisms explaining heterogeneity and scaling is our focus, not exclusively benchmark metrics.
