# Goals of this platform

The Community Understanding Platform of Terrestrial Exchanges with the Atmosphere (CUP of TEA) is a community effort to work on improving consideration of heterogeneity at the land-atmosphere interface. 
This platform allows:
1. Interactive visualisation of field measurements and model results
1. Benchmark metrics on the capacity of models to capture spatio-temporal heterogeneity 
1. Users can add standardized datasets, models, and benchmark metrics

This website and data analysis are open-source, transparent, and users are encouraged to contribute. 

# Data storage

Datasets are not hosted on github, rather they are downloaded from DOI (e.g. [Figshare] (https://figshare.com/))
