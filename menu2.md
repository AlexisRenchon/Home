# Benchmarking metrics for heterogeneity

Ability of the model to capture:
1. Diurnal, seasonal and inter-annual variability
1. Spatial variability
1. Hot spot and hot moments
1. At what scale does X predict Y

# Wavelet analysis 

Wavelet analysis in time and space. 

# Quantify spatio-temporal variability

Quantify spatial and temporal variability (e.g. is there a lot of heterogeneity? Need a metric).
