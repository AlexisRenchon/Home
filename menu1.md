# Source code 

[A first example] (https://alexisrenchon.github.io/TEST/soil), using a testbed dataset at Argonne National Laboratory. 

[A second example] (https://alexisrenchon.github.io/TEST/DAMM/), showing the Dual Arrhenius Michaelis-Menten model. 

These interactive figure are coded in [Julia] (https://julialang.org/) using [Makie] (https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl). 

The source code generating these figures is hosted [here] (https://github.com/Land-atmosphere-interface-heterogeneity/GIF-TEROS11-Julia), a package will be available soon.
