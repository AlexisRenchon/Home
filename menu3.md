# Description of standardized format for datasets

The platform is designed for datasets of land-atmosphere exchanges (e.g. NEE, ET, Rsoil), and land/atmosphere properties (e.g. soil moisture, air temperature, plant biomass density), measured at high resolution in time and/or space, in an area of about a hectar.

Datasets for these experimental designs are currently integrated:
1. Eddy-covariance datasets  
1. Land-atmosphere exchange or land/atmosphere propertie at X locations, measured at Y temporal resolution
1.
