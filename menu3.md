# Description of standardized format for datasets

The platform is designed for datasets of land-atmosphere exchanges (e.g. NEE, ET, Rsoil), and land/atmosphere variable (e.g. soil moisture, air temperature, plant biomass density), measured at high resolution in time and/or space, in an area of about a hectar.

Datasets for these experimental designs are currently integrated:
1. Eddy-covariance datasets  
1. Land-atmosphere exchange or land/atmosphere variable at X locations, measured at Y temporal resolution
1. Scaling dataset: e.g. X locations within 100 m2, 10 m2, 1 m2, etc.
