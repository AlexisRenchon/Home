This experimental design was used at Argonne National Laboratory, near building 484. This site is a testbed to design land-atmosphere heterogeneity studies.

Soil moisture and temperature are measured at 15 cm depth at 30 minutes frequency, at the 64 locations shown. Soil respiration is measured manually bi-weekly at these locations.
